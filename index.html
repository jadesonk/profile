        <p>
          I was a frontend developer working in corporate tech; who, began to struggle and lose his sense of self to the systems and structures in the corporate world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving forward, I am looking to find the childlike curiosity and passion in me again; while, expanding my skills into full-stack development. I want to create products from end to end, whether it be my own or with like-minded people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning code has allowed me to travel and work with people all over the world. Technology and this digital age we live in has made this all possible, and I want to do my part to be a part of it. We are not confined to any one place or path anymore. With this in mind, I am looking to move into the freelance and/or startup scene and be an explorer of the digital age.
